Vision Statement: To encourage students at Middle College High School
to improve their attendance with a simple, user-friendly attendance 
tracking system.

We are developing an attendance tracking system for schools with a more
fluid schedule. Attendance will be tracked by time spent at school, where
coming early and staying late is encouraged. Users can generate and export
easy-to-read reports, and administrative accounts can override stored data.
In addition, students will be motivated by positive reinforcement through
a virtual rewards system. These rewards come as badges that students can
collect upon completion of certain goals related to their attendance.
Students can view theirs earned badges and attendance records and choose
one to display to everyone with their picture on the login screen.
